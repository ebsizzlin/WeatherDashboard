# WeatherDashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

# User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

# Completed

- weather dashboard, form inputs
- cityList function (local storage, search display, API response)
- locationWeather function (empty, append, correctly drawing from network, current conditions API response)
- 4 queryURLs
- forecastsAll hide & show onclick
- 5 day forecast API response in network (though not yet displayed properly)
- for loop attempt

# Future Fixes

- add date
- temperature # doesn't make sense
- how to change button color depending on favorable, moderate, severe (if statements for green yellow red?)
- make locationWeather a card / a nice border
- figure out the for loop / why 'response' is udnefined
- change searches to buttons that can be clicked on
- keep local storage displayed (via work scheduler hw)
