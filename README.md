# WeatherDashboard

Built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provided basic setup and usage instructions. Used `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

# User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

# Completed

- weather dashboard, form inputs
- searching for city: cityList function (local storage, search display, API response)
- current conditions: locationWeather function (empty, append, correctly drawing from network, current conditions API response)
- future conditions: 5 day forecast API response in network & displayed
- 4 queryURLs
- hide & show onclick
- UV button
- moment.js
- math.floor calculations work

# Future Additions

- how to change button color depending on favorable, moderate, severe

- bonus: enter button search
- bonus: refresh and it shows last searched
- bonus: change searches to buttons that can be clicked on & keep them displayed when you reseach (work schedule hw?)
